## The card game of Concentration

Below you will be able to download the Careware game of Concentration for Windows 95 and above.

The program was originally released in 1998 and updated thru to 2002 - but it still works today!

Just don't make the main window too wide as the program just can't handle it.

Concentration is played by two players (human and/or computer). The game starts with all 52 cards in the deck being placed face down on the play area. Player One begins the game by flipping any two cards in the play area. If the two flipped cards match, then those two cards are removed from the play area and the player gains two points and another turn. If the two flipped cards do not match, then the two cards are returned to their original face down positions and it becomes the other player's turn. Once all the cards have been matched the game ends. The player who has the most matches (points) at the end of the game wins.

**Careware**

I'm sure you've heard of the shareware concept, where the author of a program for his or her hard work requests that you send them a payment. With this program I would like to introduce you to the concept of careware. If you plan to keep and/or use this program, Concentration, then you are asked to donate $5 to someone much less fortunate than yourself.
